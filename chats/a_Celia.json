What brings you here today? Are you working with Peter as well?\n\n*Celia leans in slightly, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone* I have to admit, I'm a bit of a bookworm myself.

Peter's been kind enough to offer me some guidance and support in getting started on my own magical journey.\n\n*Elaina leans back in her chair, her eyes sparkling with excitement*\n\nBut I have to say, I'm just as curious about you, Celia! *smirks* Your love of reading about magic is totally relatable.

Have you read any of their books?\n\n*Celia's mention of being a bookworm is met with a knowing nod from Elaina*\n\nOh, I'm the same! *grins* There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good book about magic and the supernatural.

But I also love reading about magic systems and how they work. Do you have any favorite magical theories or concepts that you find particularly interesting?\n\n*Celia's grin widens as she continues*\n\nAnd speaking of interests, I've been fascinated by the idea of spirit mages like yourself.

He's got this amazing ability to connect with people on a deep level, which is just incredible.
